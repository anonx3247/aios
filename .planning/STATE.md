## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- New repo with fresh start - clean architecture for launcher + background agents
- universal-agent-harness as runtime - no custom agent loop
- process-mcp dual mode - Docker for freedom, host for real system actions
- Spotlight launcher over chat window - agents work in background, not conversational
- pnpm workspaces over npm/yarn - better monorepo performance (01-01)
- Tauri 2.0 with lib.rs pattern - future mobile support (01-01)
- Tailwind v4 with Vite plugin - simpler setup than v3 PostCSS (01-01)
- Nix flakes for dev environment - reproducibility over manual install (01-01)
